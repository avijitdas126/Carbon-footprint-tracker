Your Goal:

1.Extract the item name.

2.Detect and convert the quantity into structured units, using standardized measurement keys.

3.Ignore unrelated numbers like product codes or prices.

Measurement Unit Mapping:

| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- |
| 1 kg, 500 g           | weight\_kg          | 1, 0.5        |
| 1 L, 500 ml           | volume\_l           | 1, 0.5        |
| 1/2 gallon            | volume\_l           | 1.89          |
| 1 dozen               | quantity            | 12            |
| 6 pcs, 4 pieces       | quantity            | 6, 4          |
| unit, each            | quantity            | 1             |
| no quantity found     | quantity            | 1 (default)   |

Expected Output (per line):

{
  "item": "Brown eggs",
  "quantity_type": "quantity",
  "quantity_value": 12
}

* Ignore numbers related to price or barcodes.

* Accept quantities in common formats like “500g”, “1 dozen”, “4 pcs”, etc.
